Project Title: Simple Python Chatbot

Project Description:

This project showcases a basic chatbot built using Python. The chatbot is designed to interact with users through text-based conversations, responding to specific keywords or phrases. Itâ€™s a simple yet effective demonstration of how chatbots work and serves as an excellent introduction to the concepts of natural language processing and conditional logic.

Key Features: User Interaction: The chatbot engages in a text-based conversation with the user. It listens to user inputs and responds accordingly, providing a basic conversational experience.

Case-Insensitive Input Handling: The chatbot converts all user inputs to lowercase, ensuring that it can understand inputs regardless of capitalization, making the interaction more user-friendly.

Keyword-Based Responses: The chatbot responds to specific keywords in the user's input:

Greeting Response: When the user says "hello," the bot responds with a friendly greeting.

Status Check: When asked "how are you," the bot provides a simple, pre-defined response.

Farewell Message: When the user says "bye," the bot ends the conversation with a goodbye message.

Bot Introduction: If the user asks for the bot's name, it introduces itself.

Continuous Interaction Loop: The chatbot runs in a continuous loop, allowing for multiple exchanges with the user until the user decides to quit the conversation by typing "quit."

Simple and Readable Code: The project is written using basic Python programming constructs, making it easy to understand and modify. It is ideal for beginners looking to get started with chatbot development.

How to Run the Project: Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

Run the Script: Copy the provided code into a Python file, and run the script using a Python interpreter. The chatbot will start interacting with you in the terminal.

Interact with the Bot: Type in your messages and see how the chatbot responds. Type "quit" to end the conversation.

Future Enhancements: While this chatbot is basic, it serves as a foundation for more advanced projects. Future improvements could include:

Integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) for more intelligent responses. Adding a broader range of conversational topics. Implementing a more sophisticated user input analysis to handle complex queries.
